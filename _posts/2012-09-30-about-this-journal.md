>I can already hear my friends thinking: "Why the hell create a journal about fitness?
>Haven't we seen enough of this guy's stuff on facebook and instagram yet?"


I don't care, I do it for <em>me</em>.
This way I'm able to create a document full of valuable data to learn from in the future. 
I love keeping track of meals, training data, progress pictures and most important of all: it keeps me motivated.

Being a web-developer, an online journal is my way of creating content with some historical value. It's free, transparent and open for anybody to comment on. It's hopefully helpful for others and I might even inspire people to get healthy as well.

Next to the occasional article about working out, new running shoes or meal planning, I'll be sharing recepies, progress pictures and workout data.
