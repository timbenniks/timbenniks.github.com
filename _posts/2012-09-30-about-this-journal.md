Aside from a short period in high school I have always been a chubby kid.
When I still lived at home my mom used to make sure I didn't go overboard with food.
She stopped me here and there when needed and always made sure we had delicious and healthy food on the table.

After high school I started living on my own and became a lot more active as a musician. 
I quickly got used a very burgundian lifestyle. I ate all kinds of junk and drank a lot of alcohol.

I have always been interested in people who looked ripped and lean but never had the discipline to get there myself. I preferred being a lazy musician and with that comes free drinks and fast food either before or after the gig. I also loved these easy refined foods that come in packages with a shitload of ingredients you don't understand.

When I reached 115kg I was in such bad shape that I felt horrible. Always sweating, tired and out of breath. I had high blood pressure and was often sick.

##The turning point
I knew for a while that things had to change. I just didn't know where to begin. I knew nothing about food and fitness.

Then I met Chris. A new guy at work. Next to a great web-developer he was also very fit and very enthousiastic about sports and diet. We became mates and he decided he wanted to help me out.
