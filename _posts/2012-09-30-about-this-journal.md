Aside from a short period in high school I have always been a chubby kid.
When I still lived at home my mom used to make sure I didn't go overboard with food.
She stopped me here and there when needed and always made sure we had delicious and healthy food on the table.

After high school I started living on my own and became a lot more active as a musician. 
I got used to a very burgundian lifestyle and started eating all kinds of junk. The free drinks for musicians also didn't help.

I have always been interested in muscles and posture but never had the discipline to change myself into something I wanted to be. I quickly turned into a lazy musician. Free drinks and fast food either before or after a gig were the norm. I didn't know any better and ate highly refined foods that contain a shitload of ingredients I didn't understand. It was easy and fast.

Being fat was always in the back of my head and it nagged at me. When I reached 115kg (253lbs) I was in such bad shape that I felt horrible. Always sweating, tired and out of breath. I had high blood pressure and was often sick.

Even after this turning point I was still completely inadequate at sports and I didn't have any discipline. I didn't even know how to properly contract my muslces to lift something. No body sense at all.

I asked my mate Chris to help me out. He was (is) a complete legend and helped my out. He kicked my ass when needed and tought me about lifting weights, running, plyometrics and diet.
