Aside from a short period in high school I have always been a chubby kid.
When I still lived at home my mom used to make sure I didn't go overboard with food.
She stopped me here and there when needed and always made sure we had delicious and healthy food on the table.

After high school I started living on my own and became a lot more active as a musician. 
I quickly got used a very burgundian lifestyle. I ate all kinds of junk and drank a lot of alcohol.
