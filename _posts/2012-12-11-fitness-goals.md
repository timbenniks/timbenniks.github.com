I want to be at 10% bodyfat by May 26 2013. I will measure the fat percantage with the same Body Fat Calipers I always use. My current body fat percentage is ~14%.

I want to be able to do 15 widegrip pull-ups without stopping and with proper form by May 26 2013.
To be able to reach 15 reps I have to add two extra reps to my set for the first four months and one more the last two months.

I want to be able to do 20 dips without stopping and with proper form by May 26 2013.

I want to be able to bench-press my bodyweight (90kg) for 8 reps by May 26 2013.
I can currently do 80kg for 5 reps. To be able to reach 90kg for 8 reps, I need to add ~2kg each month.

I want to run a half marathon in under two hours without stopping by May 26 2013.

I want my 1RM for the deadlift to be 150kg by May 26 2013.
I can currently lift 115kg for 3 reps. To be able to lift 150kg I need to add ~6kg a month.
