Well, I don't care I do it for <em>me</em>.
I do it to create a document full of valuable data to learn from in the future.
Keeping track helps me to stay motivated.

Being a web-developer, an online journal is my way of creating content. 
It's easily accessible, transparent and open for anybody to comment on.
Next to my own benefit it would be awesome if this journal could inspire other people to get healthy as well.

Next to the occasional article about working out, new running shoes or meal planning, I'll be sharing recipes, progress pictures and workout data.
