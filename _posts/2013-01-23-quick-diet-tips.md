## 1. No-carb or extremely low-carb diets are bad.
These diets can cause everything from low energy to flat muscles to impaired workout performance to depression to bad health.

## 2. Think of carbs as energy.
Getting fewer carbs at a meal than the energy you require can force your body to burn stored bodyfat for fuel.

## 3. Carb stack, if possible.
Carb stacking means eating the majority of your daily carbs in the morning. This can increase fat burning later in the day.

## 4. Always include plenty of carbs and protein in the meal immediately following a workout.
If you don't, your muscle repair and growth may be impaired. Go for 60gr of fast carbs and 40gr of fast protein (whey).

## 5. Never eat carb-only meals.
Combination (carb/protein/fat) meals slow down the speed at which glucose enters your bloodstream.
In other words, combining carbs with other foods can prevent insulin surges that can increase bodyfat storage.
This only works as long as you don't eat too much at one sitting.
Each meal should be no more than 350 calories, except after a workout.

## 6. Try to choose natural carbs.
Choose fruits and vegetables over processed carbs like sugary candy, cake and so on.
Processed carbs are calorie- and carb-dense and can stop fat burning and cause fat deposition because of the excess energy they supply.
Eating processed carbs can also cause health problems due to lack of vitamins and minerals and fibers.

## 7. Get 20 to 40 grams of protein at each of your five to six meals a day.
That will insure that muscle building blocks are always readily available and signal your body that it's ok to build more muscle.
