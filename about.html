	<h3>About my job</h3>
	<p>I work as a senior web-developer at <a href="http://www.akqa.com" target="_blank" title="I work at AKQA">AKQA</a>. We do awesome work for clients like Tommy Hilfiger, EA Sports, Nike and many others.</p>
	<p>My role is to create the front-end strategy for these companies. As we mainly build global platforms, accessibility, speed, scalability and responsive design patterns are of vital importance.</p>
	
	<h3>I am a musician</h3>
	<p>I play guitar in a band called <a href="http://www.bluesmotel.nl" target="_blank" title="My band">BluesMotel</a>. At least once a week we play in a smoky pub somewhere in the Netherlands, the UK or France.</p>
	<p>BluesMotel is a blues band from the Netherlands and plays authentic blues in the style of Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, Little Walter, Elmore James and more. BluesMotel distinguishes itself by playing a mix of straight blues, standards, own compositions and unique songs. All down-home blues.</p>
