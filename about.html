		As a senior web-developer at <a href="http://www.akqa.com" target="_blank" title="I work at AKQA">AKQA</a> 
		I get to do awesome work for clients like Tommy Hilfiger, EA Sports, Nike, Mini, Philips and others.

	<p>
		Next to being a geek I play guitar in a band called <a href="http://www.bluesmotel.nl" target="_blank" title="My band">BluesMotel</a>. 
		At least once a week we play in a smoky pub somewhere in the Netherlands, the UK or France.
	</p>
	<p>
		BluesMotel is a blues band from the Netherlands and plays authentic blues in the style of Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, Little Walter, 
		Elmore James and more. BluesMotel distinguishes itself by playing a mix of straight blues, standards, own compositions and unique songs. 
		All down-home blues.
